#import (at least) the pandas and seaborn libraries using their usual alias "as"
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sb

#create a dataframe from the seaborn dataset called "mpg"
sb.get_dataset_names()

df = sb.load_dataset ('mpg')

#take a look at the first 25 rows
df.head(25)

# We learned about a couple of charts that are good for looking
# at categorical data, like "origin", which is the location of manufacture
# for the cars in the mpg dataset.

# Draw one kind of chart that's good for looking at a single categorical variable, "origin"
sb.countplot(df, x="origin")

# And now, draw another basic chart for categorical data, and use it to graph "origin"
sb.histplot(df, x="origin")

# What chart would you use to look at the distribution of a continuous variable like "weight"?
# Draw it here
sb.boxplot(df, x="weight")

# And finally, how would you draw a plot that examined the relationship between two categorical
# variables like "horsepower" and "weight"?  Generally, weight would be the independent variable,
# as the weight of a car normally determines the needed horspower, not the other way around.
# Using this assumption, draw an appropriate plot here.

sb.scatterplot(df, x="weight", y="horsepower", hue="origin") #Just trying different things, I know you didn't ask for origin
