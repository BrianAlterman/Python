#Exercise 1 - Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her name. The program should respond with a message that 
#says hello to the user, using his or her name.

print ("Exercise 1\n") #the '\n' skips a line after the print

Name = input("Enter your name: ")

print ("Hello",Name)

#Exercise 2 - Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once these values have been 
#read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as 
#ﬂoating-point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit 
#you are more comfortable working with.

print("Exercise 2\n") #the '\n' skips a line after the print
print("Today we will be calulating the area of a room in square feet")

width = float(input("Please enter the width in feet: "))

area = length * width

print("The area of the room is",area,"square feet")

#Exercise 3 - Create a program that reads the length and width of a farmer’s ﬁeld from the user in feet. Display the 
#area of the ﬁeld in acres. The formula for finding acres when you have square feet is square feet / 43,560.

print("Exercise 3\n") #the '\n' skips a line after the print
print("Today we will be calulating the area of a field in acres")

length = float(input("Please enter the length of the field in feet: "))

print("But are those acres green...")

#Exercise 4 - In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. In one 
#particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a  $0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding
#more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit.
#Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size from the user. Your program should continue by computing 
#and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers. Extra credit: format the output so that it 
#includes a dollar sign and two digits to the right of the decimal point.

#want to use the decimal object and the quantize function to return a float value with two decimal places.

print("Good work recycling, you are help making the world a better place...")

#Exercise 5 - Write a program that reads an integer from the user. Then your program should display a message indicating whether the integer is even or odd.
print("Exercise 4\n") #the '\n' skips a line after the print
print("Today we will be determining if a nuber is odd or even\n")

numcheck = int(input("Enter a number to check whether it is odd or even:"))
